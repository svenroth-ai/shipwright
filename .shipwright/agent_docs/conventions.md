## Project-specific rules

Python 3.11+ with uv as package manager. All scripts are invoked via uv run. Hooks resolve plugin paths via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}. Config files written to target projects use the prefix shipwright_ (e.g. shipwright_run_config.json) and environment variables use SHIPWRIGHT_ (e.g. SHIPWRIGHT_SESSION_ID, SHIPWRIGHT_PLUGIN_ROOT). Commits follow Conventional Commits with the plugin name as scope (e.g. fix(adopt): ..., feat(security): ...). Branches for self-monorepo work follow iterate/<short-kebab-description>. After any push that touches plugin-side files, scripts/update-marketplace.sh syncs the runtime plugin cache. Linting uses ruff; type-checking uses pyright; tests use pytest. The canonical user-facing documentation is docs/guide.md; the canonical hook + pipeline reference is docs/hooks-and-pipeline.md. CLAUDE.md captures operational rules; generated agent_docs link back rather than duplicating these sources of truth.

## Commit messages

- Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Scopes should reflect module boundaries (e.g., `feat(auth): ...`)

## Files

- Keep files under 300 lines; split larger modules.
- Tests live alongside implementation with `.test.*` / `_test.*` suffix OR in a `tests/` directory — whichever is consistent with the rest of the codebase.

## Learnings

> Each learning is compacted to its one-line rule; the full rationale, worked example, and origin for every entry is preserved verbatim in [`../planning/adr/_archive-agent-doc-updates.md`](../planning/adr/_archive-agent-doc-updates.md). (Compacted by iterate-2026-06-12-compress-agent-doc-backlog.)

- **Relocating a shared symbol to a new home + back-compat re-export: migrate only consumers whose import edit stays net-zero/≤limit; a grandfathered (>300 LOC) consumer must STAY on the re-export — adding a `from <new-home> import …` line ratchets its bloat past baseline (a hard CI gate), and growing other oversized files to chase import purity inverts a bloat-reduction iterate. A lazy (call-time) re-export breaks the home→consumer→home import cycle a module-level one would create.** (iterate-2026-06-12-repo-root-resolver-relocate)
- **A `from_dict` deserializer must coerce explicit-null via `or []` / `or {}`, NOT `d.get(key, default)` — the default only fires on an ABSENT key, so an event carrying `affected_frs: null` yields None and bricks every downstream consumer (here it crashed the whole compliance MD regen). 2nd occurrence in `collectors/_types.py` after `TestRunEvent.layers`; treat `or <empty>` as the house rule for nullable JSON list/dict fields.** (iterate-2026-06-12-workevent-null-frs-coerce)
- **The empirical gate enforced depth (asymptote) + breadth (coverage ledger) but not COMPOSITION (do cross-component pieces compose), so FRAMEWORK changes shipped unit-tested-but-integration-unproven (the merge cascade). New `cross_component` flag → required `category:"integration"` behavior at medium+, enforced NON-dodgeably by the F11 verifier RECOMPUTING the flag from the diff (not an agent-report). Detector SSoT in `classify_complexity`, drift-pinned copy in the verifier.** (iterate-2026-06-12-cross-component-gate)
- **Probe for an executable by TEST-RUNNING it (e.g. `"$c" --version >/dev/null 2>&1`), not `command -v` alone: on Windows `python3` is a Microsoft Store App-Execution-Alias stub that `command -v` finds on PATH but that exits 49 on invocation, so a `command -v`-only resolver under `set -euo pipefail` picks it and aborts at the first real call (`$(python3 -c …)`). `command -v` proves the name resolves, not that it runs.** (iterate-2026-06-12-marketplace-python3-stub-probe)
- **"Delivered" = the PR is actually MERGED with all Required Checks GREEN, confirmed by watching it to terminal — arming auto-merge (or pushing) and walking away is "shoot and forget"; a check can fail afterward and sit BLOCKED, red, un-merged. F11 runs `watch_pr_delivery.py` and fails closed on anything but merged. Corollary: the `shared/tests` F0 run misses iterate-plugin content-lints (the agent-doc 600-char budget gate), so re-run them after F2/F3a before push.** (iterate-2026-06-12-delivery-watch)
- **`merge=union` extends past the JSONL append-logs to the curated agent-docs whose `## …Updates`/`## Learnings` sections are bullet-prepended by parallel iterates: a DISTINCT `CURATED_DOC_UNION_PATHS` category keeps both bullets (server-side too), closing the prose half of the cascade the regenerate resolver can't touch; accepted caveat — union is silent on a same-line non-append edit.** (iterate-2026-06-12-union-curated-agent-docs)
- **A whole-set checker over shared, gitignored, cross-branch-accumulating state must scope to per-tree ownership (run_id in the committed `shipwright_events.jsonl`), and "fail-open when the ownership ledger is absent" is what keeps it from breaking hermetic tests + CI; reproduction needs a tree whose *tracked* state trails the *accumulated* gitignored state, not a clean fork.** (iterate-2026-06-12-arch-drift-test-scope)
- **A projection over a human-authored markdown skeleton must tolerate inline emphasis, and "verify X regenerates without downgrade" is not a no-op AC.** → archive

- **F0.5 `surface_verification.py --surface cli --runner "..."` execs WITHOUT a shell — the runner must be a single executable, not a compound `cd … && …`.** (iterate-2026-06-07-campaign-expands-triage) → archive
- **`test_architecture_md_reflects_arch_impact.py::test_arch_impact_drops_found_at_all` is born-fragile against the post-release main-tree state.** (iterate-2026-06-07-finalization-tooling-hardening) → archive

- **Gitignored test fixtures are absent in fresh worktrees/clones.** (iterate-2026-05-16-fix-adopt-review-config) → archive
- **A triage `source` is not always a unique producer identity — an auto-resolve pass must scope by the dedup-key shape it owns.** (iterate-2026-05-16-fix-triage-dedup-resolve) → archive
- **A load-bearing "always" step enforced only by prose gets skipped — convert it to a gate.** (iterate-2026-05-16-spec-impact-gate) → archive
- **Bash hooks must resolve a Python interpreter — never hardcode `python3`.** (iterate-2026-05-18-fix-launch-blocker-tests) → archive

- **Artifact contents are untrusted CI output — render aggregated counts only, never raw scanner strings.** (iterate-2026-05-21-security-artifact-producer) → archive
- **Tracked-but-derived artifacts need a single producer + snapshot-provenance audit, NOT live-render byte-compare.** (iterate-2026-05-23-compliance-md-single-producer) → archive
- **Avoid `sys.path.insert(0, ".../shared/scripts")` in plugin code — use `audit_adapters.load_shared_lib(name)` instead.** (iterate-2026-05-23-compliance-md-single-producer) → archive
- **Markdown table rows are also a producer/consumer boundary — but the consumer is the human eye / GFM viewer, not a shipwright parser.** (iterate-2026-05-20-escape-md-cells) → archive
- **`importlib.metadata` is disqualifying for compliance tooling — its `sys.path` lookup is ambient process state.** (iterate-2026-05-23-sbom-resolver-pin-lockfile) → archive

- **A finalize sandbox-escape via stale session→worktree pointer is the second-most-common single-producer failure mode after "two producers."** → archive

- **Branch integration: `git merge`, not `git rebase`, for Run-ID-bearing branches.** → archive
- **Audit-coverage extension to docs added AFTER the last snapshot needs a "not-in-snapshot" semantic, not a stale verdict.** → archive

- **A patch that "rides inline" with a campaign silently vanishes unless the campaign's sub-iterate plans explicitly name it.** (iterate-2026-05-29-sp3-os2-reintegration) → archive
- (2026-06-12) iterate — When making a routing oracle impact-aware, read ALL candidate target docs unconditionally; checking only an impact's primary target silently breaks a cross-target legacy fallback (the convention→architecture.md fallback false-failed until both docs were loaded). → iterate-2026-06-12-agent-doc-entry-rules.
- **When compacting an always-loaded doc to one-line pointers, an entry pinned by a drift-protection test is load-bearing — keep its pinned phrases inline, don't archive them away.** Blanket bolded-lead compression dropped the E2E learning's "Backend-affects-Frontend" sub-rule that `test_skill_e2e_gate_consistency.py` requires in conventions.md. Grep every test that reads the doc for asserted phrases BEFORE compressing. → iterate-2026-06-12-compress-agent-doc-backlog.
- **GitHub auto-merge runs a server-side 3-way merge and CANNOT run the regenerate-at-merge resolver — safe ONLY for a single iterate whose branch is current.** Parallel/concurrent iterate PRs that each commit regenerated snapshots cascade `DIRTY` (snapshot conflict → auto-merge stalls) or merge stale (Group-E); bring a branch current THROUGH `integrate_main` (the `ensure_current.py` refresh-if-behind guard) BEFORE it merges. (iterate-2026-06-12-automerge-serial-integrate) → decision_log (Run-ID).
- **An iterate's base is the worktree (clean `origin/main`), not the dirty main working tree — re-baseline scouting there before editing.** A task-named `drift_anchor.py` target was only uncommitted main-tree WIP, absent from `origin/main`; write the multi-site drift-guard test first — its collection error exposes phantom targets. (iterate-2026-06-12-canonical-project-predicate) → decision_log (Run-ID).

## Contributing

Contribution rules, dev setup, the graduated trust model, and high-sensitivity areas live in the root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — the single source of truth. (Previously copied here verbatim by /shipwright-adopt; replaced with this link to keep always-loaded Layer-1 context lean — iterate-2026-06-12-agent-doc-entry-rules.)

- **ADR-120** (2026-06-02): Dedup SessionStart Phase-Quality injection to once-per-event
- **(2026-06-05, iterate gitleaks-report-path)**: gitleaks `--report-path -` is NOT stdout — gitleaks does `os.Create("-")` and writes a literal file named `-` (verified v8.21.2 `cmd/root.go`+`report/report.go`). Read the JSON report from a real temp file, not subprocess stdout. **Gotcha (sharpens the line-26 "verify against the REAL run" learning):** a "detects on Windows, 0 on Linux CI" scanner story can be a *measurement artifact* — the manual repro command omitted the wrapper's `--report-path -`, so it surfaced gitleaks' own stderr summary (detection) while the wrapper read empty stdout (0 findings) on every platform. Verify the exact wrapped command's output channel (stdout vs report-file) against the real binary before concluding platform divergence. Fingerprint: a stray file named `-` left in the scan CWD (it held the real finding).

- **(2026-06-06, iterate arch-drift-detector)**: **A drift detector that diffs the git HISTORY of gitignored inputs can never fire.** Group F's F5 used `git log <marker>..HEAD -- .shipwright/agent_docs/decision-drops/` to find "new" arch-impact drops, but decision-drops are gitignored — never committed, so the diff was always empty and F5 was permanently green while `architecture.md` silently drifted from 5 real drops (no triage item). The fix is **content reconciliation**, not history-diffing: read the drop JSON + the tracked `architecture.md` text and assert each arch-impact `run_id` appears (the exact oracle the drift test already used). General rule: if a check's INPUTS are gitignored staging, any git-history-based oracle over them is structurally dead — reconcile the staging content against the tracked artifact directly. Two corollaries: (1) **share one oracle** between a detective (surfaces existing drift) and its finalize gate (prevents new drift) — here `shared/scripts/lib/architecture_doc.py` is imported by Group F (via `audit_adapters.load_shared_lib`, which avoids pinning the `lib` namespace) AND by the F11 verifier (via `from lib.architecture_doc`) — so they cannot diverge. (2) **a prose-only "always update X" step that has no live gate WILL drift** (the old `check_architecture_reviewed` was dead code with zero callers + an mtime heuristic that never checked content); convert it to a canon gate (`check_architecture_documented` in `verify_iterate_finalization`). Match `run_id` with `(?<![\w-])id(?![\w-])`, not bare substring — run_ids contain hyphens so `\b` is unreliable and a prefix run_id would falsely satisfy a longer one. Gitignored-staging detectives `skip` in clean CI (inputs absent), so the finalize gate is the authoritative prevention layer.

- **(2026-06-07, iterate triage-docs-monorepo-migration)**: **Migrating a MAIN-tree data pile (`triage.jsonl`) via a worktree iterate.** The live curated pile lives in main's working tree (no committed jsonl yet); a worktree off `origin/main` has none. Pattern: GC main's pile in place (`triage_gc --apply` — leak-guard-exempt for `triage.jsonl` per C2's `_MAIN_TREE_WRITE_EXEMPT`, so it doesn't trip f0/f11), then COPY the canonical snapshot into the worktree so F6 ships it in the PR (option b — stays in the normal review flow). **Gotcha:** don't run `update_compliance` to "settle" a producer's keys (e.g. A's signature-only SBOM ids) when no OPEN items of that source remain — the re-emit/dismiss cycle already ran in background, and the run would dirty main's clean compliance MDs (NOT leak-guard-exempt) and STOP the F0 gate. Verify a destructive GC by diff invariants against the `.bak` (removed ⊆ dismissed, 0 open/promoted lost, validator clean), not by trusting the tool's own summary count.

- **iterate-2026-06-10-event-self-id** (2026-06-10): pytest `-m` on the CLI REPLACES the `addopts` marker filter — `-m "not cross_plugin"` silently re-enabled the `slow` suite (D2V concurrency-stress spawners). Always compose: `-m "not slow and not cross_plugin"`.

- **(2026-06-10, iterate finalize-resolver / campaign S3)**: **Don't reuse the global "regenerate ALL derived snapshots" pattern for a PER-ENTITY derived artifact.** The churn resolver re-derives the *global singleton* DERIVED_MDs (one dashboard, one SBOM…) by globbing — safe because there's one of each and they round-trip. Mirroring that for per-campaign `status.json` (glob ALL campaigns on every integrate) was destructive: the projection schema doesn't losslessly round-trip a *legacy* `campaign.md` (bold-id cells parse as new subs → real `complete` subs drop to `pending`/`null`; unknown committed sub-fields stripped), so re-deriving an UNTOUCHED campaign silently corrupted its tracked board. Review caught it (B1) by dry-running the producer against the *real* campaign corpus, not fixtures. **Rule:** scope a merge-time regeneration to the entities the merge actually TOUCHED (here: campaign `status.json` files that CONFLICTED — `complete_merge.resolved` → `integrate_main` → `regenerate_tracked_snapshots(campaign_status_rels=…)`); leave an untouched entity byte-identical and let it self-heal on its own next write (never-downgrade makes that safe). Corollary: verify a producer that runs automatically on shared state against the LIVE data, not a clean fixture — a fixture hides exactly the legacy-shape rows that break round-trip.

- **(2026-06-11, iterate bloat-gate-worktree-baseline)**: **A check that compares a MEASUREMENT to a THRESHOLD must read both from the same tree.** The bloat Stop-gate re-measured the worktree file but read its ceiling from MAIN's baseline — so a worktree iterate that bumped a baseline via ADR (committed in the worktree, not yet on main) false-blocked at Stop, even though pre-commit + CI anti-ratchet (which read the worktree baseline) passed (trg-28e83840; #150/trg-305e2aab had fixed only the path-prefix *key*, not the baseline *source*). **Rule:** when a hook fires with `main_repo_root_or(cwd)` = the MAIN root but the artifact lives under `.worktrees/<slug>/`, resolve any per-tree state (baseline, config) from THAT worktree, falling back to main — never to empty (empty = treat an already-baselined file as a new crossing). Two meta-lessons: (1) a gate is only as correct as the consistency of its two inputs — equal-strength to the CI gate is the bar (verify them against the SAME committed baseline). (2) The bloat-fix iterate itself trips the bloat gate: a worktree fix to worktree-vs-main asymmetry runs under the very machinery it fixes, so dog-foods its own regression — keep the fix file ≤300 or the Stop gate you just fixed will (correctly) flag it.

- **(2026-06-11, iterate automerge-gh-pr-ci-producer)**: **Two gh-API correctness traps for any PR-checks producer + one test-infra gotcha.** (1) `GET commits/{sha}/check-runs` returns the OBJECT form `{total_count, check_runs}` (like `actions/runs`), and a busy matrix can exceed `per_page=100` — a failing check on page 2 then reads as "all green" and false-resolves. Guard: treat `len(check_runs) < total_count` as a truncated/partial view and return `None` so the symmetry rule skips the run, rather than classifying on a partial set. (2) Pass `?filter=latest` — without it the endpoint can include a SUPERSEDED failed run alongside its green re-run for the same name, re-reddening a fixed PR. (3) A session-scoped **autouse hermetic stub** that replaces a module's network fns (to keep consumer tests off the live `gh`) also SHADOWS the unit tests OF those very fns — they silently test the stub (false green). Capture the real callables at import and expose a `real_*` opt-back-in fixture for the fetch-level unit tests; the building of the ledger (testable ⇒ tested) is what surfaced the two stubbed-and-never-really-tested rows.
- **(2026-06-11, iterate automerge-f11-arm)**: **A pipeline step that depends on an out-of-band repo/infra setting must be fail-soft, or it breaks the pipeline for everyone the moment the setting is off.** F11's auto-merge arm (`gh pr merge --auto`) errors unless the repo's "Allow auto-merge" + branch protection are enabled — a manual, deferred precondition. An unguarded call would make EVERY future iterate's finalize fail until a human flips a GitHub setting. Rule: guard such a call with `|| echo WARN …` (never `|| exit`), so a missing precondition degrades to "PR left open for manual merge" instead of a hard STOP. Two corollaries: (1) **self-modifying plugin changes don't take effect this run** — the running agent executes the *cached* skill prose, so the patch ships in a PR that a human reviews/merges, and only future iterates (post cache-sync) get the new behavior; never hand-run the new path on your own framework PR. (2) **gate behavior on the actual branch name** (`case "$head_branch" in iterate/*)`) not on an assumption that "F11 only ever sees iterate branches" — the explicit guard is what stops a copied/edited flow from self-arming a human PR.
- **(2026-06-12, iterate triage-status-idle-main-outbox)**: **A routing rule keyed off a context predicate must cover EVERY write verb, or the uncovered verb silently re-introduces the exact problem the rule eliminated.** Campaign D1 routed idle-main triage **appends** to the gitignored outbox (via `should_route_to_outbox`) so idle main stays drift-free — but `mark_status` was left **residence-derived** (status follows its append's file). Result: a status flip on a *tracked*-resident item on idle main (a WebUI dismiss, or any compliance/drift/phase-quality/F0.5 Stop-hook auto-dismiss) still wrote the tracked log = undelivered drift, blocking a hand `git pull` and never reaching origin (post-D2 the sweep delivers only the outbox; `reconcile_main_triage` is manual-CLI-only). The "append vs status" asymmetry hid for weeks because the unit fixtures had no `origin` remote (`should_route_to_outbox`=False there → the gap is invisible without a git+origin fixture). **Rules:** (1) when you add a "route writes of kind X to Y under condition C" rule, audit append/status/delete/promote — each independently; a half-applied routing rule is a latent drift source. (2) To test a predicate that probes git state (`should_route_to_outbox` = origin+default-branch), the fixture MUST build a real repo WITH an origin remote — a bare `tmp_path` exercises only the False branch and gives false confidence. (3) Keep the fix net-zero LOC on an already-bloat-exempt file (one-line the long boolean since E501 isn't in the ruff select; rationale lives in the docstring, not a 13-line inline comment) so the anti-ratchet gate doesn't force a baseline bump for a one-expression change.
