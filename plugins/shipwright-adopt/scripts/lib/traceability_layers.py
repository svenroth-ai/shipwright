"""Adopt ``required_layers`` ambiguity resolution (traceability TT7, Spec §11-R5).

Pure, total, prompt-free. When adopt reverse-engineers FRs, some have no author-chosen
``Layers`` — the collector infers them (``inferred_legacy`` / ``defaulted_legacy``). The
interactive path would ask the operator about those; an UNATTENDED run must resolve them
against P1's predeclared-decision fixture instead and **never stall** (binding). This
module classifies which FRs are ambiguous (cell authorship only — it does NOT re-infer
layers; the collector owns that, no fork) and maps each to a resolution.

Imports NO ``lib`` package (ADR-045) — split out of ``traceability_baseline`` only to
keep both modules under the 300-LOC source cap.
