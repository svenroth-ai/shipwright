# Upload Mode

When `.shipwright/designs/uploads/` contains files:

1. Scan directory for images (PNG, JPG), HTML files, and markdown files
2. **Check for visual guidelines:** If a `.md` file contains "Visual Guidelines" or design tokens (colors, typography, spacing), treat it as the project's design foundation
3. Present found files to user
4. Ask which screens they represent (for images/HTML)
5. Add to design-manifest.md with status "uploaded"
6. Generate only screens not covered by uploads
7. If visual guidelines found: use them for all generated screens, skip Step 6.5
