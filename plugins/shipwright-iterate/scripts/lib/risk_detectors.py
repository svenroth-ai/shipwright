"""Diff-driven risk detectors for the Shipwright iterate classifier.

Extracted from ``classify_complexity.py``
(iterate-2026-06-13-risk-detector-extract) so the classifier module stays
under the bloat limit. These are the *path-match* detectors a caller runs
over ``git diff --name-only`` output — distinct from the *message-keyword*
risk taxonomy (``RISK_TAXONOMY`` + ``detect_risk_flags``) which stays in
``classify_complexity``.

``classify_complexity`` re-exports every name below (so existing importers —
the ``shared.contracts.iterate`` cross-plugin contract, the test plugin's
boundary-coverage report, and the detector tests — keep resolving them from
their original home). New consumers may import from here directly.
